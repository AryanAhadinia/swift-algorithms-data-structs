# iOS-Algo-Play-Book
This is a `Playground Book` that contains examples of common `Algorithms` and `Data Structures` implemented using the latest `Swift` programming language version. The development attempts to fully utilize `Standard Library` and `Protocol-Oriented` paradigm. The book provides visualizations using `SpriteKit` and `SceneKit` frameworks.


# About 
Each major section will be wrapped into a separete `.playground` file, meaning that `data structures` and `algorithms` will be separeted for convenient management. All the explanation and code contained in `.playground` files, so here you can find just a very general overview of the what is inside. Happy evolving ðŸ¤“:octocat:
